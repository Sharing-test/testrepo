00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.470
Welcome, my friend.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.800
Glad you are joining us for
this very first session.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.550
I am really looking forward
to our discussion today.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.870
All right.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.130
Today we are tackling a very
important topic, direction, sense.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.800
It's like having your own internal
compass, but for competitive exams,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.280
concept, explanation, direction, sense is
a fundamental part of reasoning ability.

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:32.025
It tests how well you understand
directions, distances, and where things

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:34.065
are positioned relative to each other.

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:39.135
Essentially, you visualize movements
and locations based on given

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:44.595
information to master this, a
clear grasp of basic directions and

00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:47.235
turns work is absolutely essential.

00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:50.775
First, let's talk about basic directions.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:57.195
There are four primary or cardinal
directions, north, south, east, and west.

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:03.375
North is typically at the top of your
mental map south, at the bottom, east

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.775
to your right, and west to your left.

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:11.355
Now understanding turns is crucial
for solving direction sense problems.

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:15.615
A right turn means you are
turning 90 degrees clockwise

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:18.285
from your current direction.

00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:24.795
For example, if you are facing north and
take a right turn, you will face east.

00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:30.765
A left turn means turning 90 degrees,
anti-clockwise or counter-clockwise.

00:01:31.545 --> 00:01:36.946
So if you are facing north and take
a left turn, you will face west.

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:40.725
Remember, clockwise is
the way clock hands move.

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:42.705
Anti-clockwise is the opposite.

00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:44.325
Real world relevance.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.050
Now, why is this important
for an S-B-I-P-O?

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.460
Direction?

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.900
Sense isn't just theory.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.520
It directly relates to practical
banking operations and daily life.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.230
A probationary officer might
need to quickly understand and

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.910
give directions to a new branch,
navigate complex office layouts, or

00:02:05.914 --> 00:02:07.775
even interpret geographical data.

00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:13.545
The ability to visualize and process
spatial information efficiently

00:02:13.545 --> 00:02:17.355
is a valuable skill for problem
solving and effective decision

00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:19.785
making in a dynamic work environment.

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:26.175
It's truly practical breakdown
of question types based on past

00:02:26.175 --> 00:02:28.515
exam patterns, direction sense.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:33.405
Questions for the S-B-I-P-O exam generally
fall into these categories finding.

00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:39.975
The final direction makes up
approximately 30% of questions.

00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:45.855
These ask where someone is facing
or moving after a series of turns.

00:02:46.635 --> 00:02:51.555
Finding the distance accounts for
about 25% requiring calculation

00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:56.055
of total distance covered or
straight line distance finding.

00:02:56.055 --> 00:03:00.795
The relative direction is around
20%, asking for the direction of

00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:02.565
one point relative to another.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.720
Finding the shortest distance comprises
about 15% often requiring the Ian theorem.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.679
And finally, shadow based questions
around 10% involve determining directions

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:22.380
based on shadow positions during sun,
risi or sunset formulas, plus tricks

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.950
time for some handy formulas and tricks.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.450
The Raz Theorem is your
friend for shortest distance

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.250
in right angled triangles.

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:39.105
If A and B are perpendicular sides, and
C is the high use, then C equals the

00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:45.285
square root of A squared plus B squared
for net displacement track north, south,

00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:47.774
and east west movements separately.

00:03:48.554 --> 00:03:53.804
For example, five meters north,
then two meters south, gives

00:03:53.804 --> 00:03:55.484
a net of three meters north.

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:58.725
Four right divided by left turns.

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:02.204
Remember, a right turn
is 90 degrees clockwise.

00:04:02.505 --> 00:04:08.265
A left turn is 90 degrees anti-clockwise,
two consecutive right turns, or

00:04:08.265 --> 00:04:11.954
two consecutive left turns mean
facing the opposite direction.

00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:17.565
Four consecutive turns of the same kind
bring you back to the original direction.

00:04:18.344 --> 00:04:20.055
The shadow rule is simple.

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:23.325
Risi East means shadow falls West.

00:04:24.105 --> 00:04:27.075
Sunset West means Shadow falls east.

00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:31.905
If a person's shadow is to their
right, they face north in the

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:33.825
morning or south in the evening.

00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:39.255
If to their left, they face south in
the morning or north in the evening.

00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:42.795
Methods of solving how do we solve these?

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.215
First, the diagrammatic method.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:50.055
Draw a clear diagram from
a central starting point.

00:04:50.985 --> 00:04:56.565
Mark each movement with lines and arrows
indicating direction and distance.

00:04:57.345 --> 00:05:03.705
Ensure right angels for turns, determine
the final position and reduce your answer.

00:05:04.515 --> 00:05:10.695
Second, the coordinate system method,
assign your starting point as zero.

00:05:10.695 --> 00:05:12.490
Zero North is positive.

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:19.320
Y South negative Y East is
positive X West, negative X update

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.119
coordinates for each movement.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.619
Final coordinates give relative
position, which you can use

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:27.239
for distance or direction.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.710
Third, the direction tracking
method is useful for just

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.270
finding the final direction.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.120
Keep track of your current direction,
rotating 90 degrees clockwise for right

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:42.120
turns and anti-clockwise for left turns.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.060
Shortcuts plus smart techniques.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.789
Let's talk about some quick tips
for net displacement calculation.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.250
Simplify by calculating total North,
south and east West movements separately

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.430
for relative direction without drawing.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.299
Visualize.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.414
If B is north of A and C is east
of B, then C is northeast of a.

00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:12.195
Visualizing turns, mentally rotate
yourself instead of drawing every turn.

00:06:12.974 --> 00:06:16.995
If you are facing west and turn
left, you are now facing South.

00:06:18.015 --> 00:06:24.135
With Aian triplets memorize common
sets like three to 4, 5, 5 to 1213.

00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:28.635
To quickly solve shortest distance
problems for shadow logic.

00:06:28.844 --> 00:06:31.870
First, identify the sun's position then.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.080
Remember, shadows fall opposite the
sun to reduce the person's direction,

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.110
common mistakes and misconceptions.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:46.290
Now let's look at common pitfalls
to avoid confusing left and right

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.210
turns is the most frequent error.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.530
Always assume you are facing
the direction of movement.

00:06:53.415 --> 00:06:58.965
Incorrectly applying Pythagoras theorem
Only apply it when a right angled triangle

00:06:58.965 --> 00:07:04.665
forms and identify the perpendicular sides
correctly, ignoring the starting point.

00:07:04.785 --> 00:07:08.895
Directions and distances are usually
relative to the starting point.

00:07:09.765 --> 00:07:16.065
Miscalculating turns a turn is typically
90 degrees, two right turns mean facing

00:07:16.065 --> 00:07:18.435
the opposite direction, not original.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.700
Assuming straight lines.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.610
Movements are usually
straight, but shortest.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.360
Distance always is errors
in shadow problems.

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:31.680
Remember, sun's position and how
shadows fall relative to the person.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.170
WH Framework summary.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.310
Let's quickly summarize
with RWH framework.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.469
So what is it?

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.789
It's a reasoning topic, testing
understanding of directions,

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.219
distances, and relative positions.

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:48.330
Why?

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.310
Is it important?

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.590
It's crucial for spatial reasoning,
problem solving and interpreting

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.090
geographical information.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.100
When is it applied?

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:06.510
In scenarios involving navigation, mapping
and determining relative locations, where

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:12.840
is it used in daily life for travel,
academic reasoning tests and workplace

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.060
tasks requiring spatial awareness.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.160
Who needs to know this?

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.620
Students, professionals in
logistics, urban planning, and anyone

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.600
needing to interpret spatial data.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.460
How do we solve it?

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:32.040
By drawing diagrams, using coordinate
systems, and applying geometric

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.930
principles to track movements and
positions fully worked out examples,

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.260
time to put our knowledge into practice.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.910
Example one.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.380
Question.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.280
A person walks three meters
towards the west, then turns

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.110
left and walks four meters.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.970
What is the shortest distance and
direction of the person from the starting

00:08:53.970 --> 00:09:04.050
point options A five meters northwest
B, five meters Southwest C seven meters

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.190
Southwest, D seven meters Northwest.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.400
Understand the question before moving to.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.110
Explanation

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.160
solution.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.010
All right, let's visualize this.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.505
The person starts,
walks three meters west.

00:09:24.425 --> 00:09:26.075
From there, they turn left.

00:09:26.955 --> 00:09:30.575
If you are facing west, a left
turn makes you face south.

00:09:31.285 --> 00:09:32.815
They then walk four meters.

00:09:34.515 --> 00:09:39.585
So from the start, they are three
meters west and four meters south,

00:09:39.885 --> 00:09:42.375
which means the direction is southwest.

00:09:43.155 --> 00:09:47.415
These movements form a right
angled triangle with sides three

00:09:47.444 --> 00:09:50.595
and four meters using petagora.

00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:55.365
The shortest distance is the high
use square root of three squared

00:09:55.365 --> 00:10:00.944
plus four squared, which is square
root of nine plus 16 equals square

00:10:00.944 --> 00:10:03.705
root of 25, which is five meters.

00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:09.405
So five meters Southwest,
this matches option B.

00:10:10.185 --> 00:10:12.435
Example two question.

00:10:12.585 --> 00:10:15.555
Ram starts walking from
his home towards the north.

00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:20.955
After walking 20 meters, he
turns right and walks 10 meters.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:24.615
He then turns left and walks 10 meters.

00:10:25.365 --> 00:10:28.574
Finally, he turns right
and walks five meters.

00:10:29.355 --> 00:10:31.694
In which direction is he now facing?

00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:33.045
Options.

00:10:33.795 --> 00:10:43.515
A North D South C East D West understand
the question before moving to explanation

00:10:46.875 --> 00:10:47.535
solution.

00:10:48.285 --> 00:10:50.084
Let's track Ram's direction.

00:10:50.865 --> 00:10:56.714
He starts facing north turns,
right, means facing East, turns

00:10:56.714 --> 00:10:58.900
left from east means facing North.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.300
Turns right from north
means facing east again.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.900
So Ram is finally facing east.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.420
This matches option C.
Example three question.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:18.510
One morning after Sun Risi ish was
standing facing a pole, the shadow

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:23.400
of the pole fell exactly to his
right, to which direction was ish

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.260
facing options a North B South.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:35.699
C East D West understand the
question before moving to explanation

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:39.750
solution.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.060
This is a shadow problem.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:49.079
One morning after sun, RISI means the
sun is in the east, therefore the shadow

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.120
of the pole falls towards the west.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.670
The shadow fell to Ish's, right?

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.329
So Ish's right side is pointing West.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:59.790
Right is West.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.350
You must be facing north.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.260
Thus was facing north.

00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:06.689
This matches option A.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.040
Thank you.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.530
See you in the next session.
